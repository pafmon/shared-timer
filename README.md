# shared-timer

 Super simple (and **heroku ready**) shared-timer using websockets (thanks to [socket.io](https://socket.io)).

To install:
```
npm install
```

To Start the server:
```
npm start
```
If $PORT is not set, by default it launches a server on port 5000


To use the timer go to `localhost:5000` and to reset/admin the timer: `localhost:5000/admin`
